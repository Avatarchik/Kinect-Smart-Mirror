# Kinect-Smart-Mirror
This application is a smart-mirror type application that overlays weather information and headlines from wired.com onto the output from the Kinect camera.  The application is activated using Haarcascades face detection in conjunction with the Kinect's depth camera.  When a person sits about 3 feet away from the camera, the overlay is activated.
